Description:

The Elvis plugin allows Elisa Viihde users to manage and watch their NPVR
recordings, timers and search timers via VDR's familiar user interface.
The plugin uses a separate 'elvis.conf' configuration file to store
settings.

Installation:

cd /put/your/path/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src
tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-elvis-X.Y.Z.tgz
ln -s elvis-X.Y.Z elvis
cd /put/your/path/here/VDR
make
make plugins
./vdr -P elvis
 
Notes:

- Remember to add a correct username and password via the setup menu
  or directly editing the 'elvis.conf' configuration file before using
  the plugin! Otherwise the main menu entry isn't visible.

- Password is currently stored unencrypted and shown in the setup menu.

- All menu contents are downloaded on background and OSD is updated only
  on demand. Therefore menus are empty for a few seconds after accessing
  them at first time.

- The menu content can be synchronized with the server by pressing the
  '5' key at any time.
